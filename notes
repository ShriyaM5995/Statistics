# ‚úÖ Hypothesis Testing Notes (Right-Tailed Z Test)

### Step-by-step

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Define Hypotheses**
- H‚ÇÄ: Œº = 40
- H‚Çê: Œº > 40

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Set Significance Level**
- Œ± = 0.05

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Collect Sample**
- xÃÑ = 25
- n = 20

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Find Standard Deviation**
- Use known œÉ, or compute sample SD if needed

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Calculate Z & p-value**
- Compare p vs Œ±:
  - If p < Œ± ‚Üí Reject H‚ÇÄ ‚Üí Statistically significant
  - If p ‚â• Œ± ‚Üí Don‚Äôt reject H‚ÇÄ ‚Üí Not significant

### ‚úÖ Quick Reference Table

| Outcome | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Reject H‚ÇÄ | Evidence supports Œº > 40 |
| Fail to Reject H‚ÇÄ | Not enough evidence that Œº increased |

### ‚ú® Notes
- Larger **n** ‚Üí stronger power
- Œ± controls **Type-I error**
- Right-tailed test focuses only on upper direction

The important lesson here is : we reject H0 when Œ±>p : Œ± is probability of Type I error(rejecting H0 when its actually True). 
But so if the probability of type I error i.e. rejecting null hypothesis is true is less than probability (p-value) that H0 is true then we reject H0. 
In this case, there is still a chance that H0 is true(5% chance) but we take that calculated risk to make a decision based on available evidence.
